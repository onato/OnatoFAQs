# Why is there repitition in the path to the FAQ file?
This is done to keep structure in the file system and to enable you to send a file to a texter or a customer for them to write or correct the FAQs. It is then imidiatly clear from the file name to which app and language it belongs.

# Do you have native Android code for displaying the FAQs
No, not at this stage. I intend to at some stage but not until I need it myself. If anyone is interested in implementing this I would be glad to hear from you. Otherwise you can dispay the HTML interface in a web view.

# How do I display a list?
1. **Is your iPhone a 4s or newer?** Bluetooth LE, which is used by heart rate sensors, is only available on newer iPhones.
2. **Wet the electrodes.** In order for the heart rate monitor to read correctly the electrodes need to be wet with water, saliva, gell or sweat.
3. **Reset bluetooth.** Go to Settings->Bluetooth and turn it off for 30 seconds. Afterwards turn it back on and try again.
4. **Change the batteries.** Removing the battery and putting it back in may help by resetting the device. If your battery is week replacing it may solve the problem.
5. **Is your sensor paired with another phone?** If so, close all apps on that phone that are paired with the device (see steps below).
6.  **Close all apps on your phone that are paired with the sensor.** The sensor will only communicate with one app at a time (see steps below).
7. **Restart your device.** If non of the above actions help try restarting your phone. If this does not help consider contacting the manufacturer of your sensor.

# How do I display something else?
  
On iOS [MMMarkdown](https://github.com/mdiep/MMMarkdown) is bing used. The PHP version uses [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/). I would suggest taking a look at the respective documentation to see which bread of markdown they are using.
